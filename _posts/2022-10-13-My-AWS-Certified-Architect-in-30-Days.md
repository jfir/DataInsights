<!--- -------Introduction-------- --->
I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate exam and I would like to share my journey and the preparation steps I did to pass the exam on my first try.

To study and learn all cloud concepts and AWS services I only followed **ONE** course, **ONE** set of Practice Exams and to save time relied on **ONE** set of notes, and I also stiked to a **strict regiment** for passing the exam in 30 days.
